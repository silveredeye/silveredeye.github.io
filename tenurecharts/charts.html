		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>Are you going to do roster change visualisations for all teams?</h3>
		<p>I hope to do all 24 teams, yes.</p>
		
		<h3>Are the charts automatically updated?</h3>
		<p>Nope. The data is manually compiled for the HTML page, it does not update automatically when there's a roster change on the Blaseball site. I wanted something that would stay up (if not current) even if I couldn't update the code for an unspecified amount of time.</p>
		
		<h3>Can I help? (Even if I don't know how to code.)</h3>
		<p>Yes! Compiling the data is a bunch of work (especially for teams who were early adopters of Fax Machine and Voicemail), if you do that I can code the team's page much faster (and credit you). And I can always use another set of eyes for stuff like "is this wonky on mobile? do these colors work? I think these should be another sorting option".</p>
		
		<h3>Can I help? (I do know how to code.)</h3>
		<p>Yes! Create a pull request. :D</p>
		
		<h3>...what's with the "university professor who last updated their site in 1998" vibe?</h3>
		<p>I do have an octogenarian professor's soul.</p>
		<p>Also, I (perhaps a little naively) wanted to make these charts something that a newbie who has no particular knowledge about coding webpages could just right-click save and muck around with. (It's my firm belief that mucking around with someone else's code and going "why do that" is the best way to learn anything.)</p>
		
		<h3>How do I contact you?</h3>
		<p>If you have a feature request/bug report/list of a team's roster changes, then you could create an issue on <a href="https://github.com/silveredeye/silveredeye.github.io/issues">this site's Github</a>. I don't as of now have a fannish Discord or Twitter, but I have a <a href="https://silveredeye.dreamwidth.org/">Dreamwidth blog</a>.</p>
