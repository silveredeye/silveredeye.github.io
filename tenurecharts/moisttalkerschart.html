					<summary>Notes about sorting</summary>
					<p>"Roster order in Season 1, roster changes cascading" sorting option attempts to give a kind of overview of who replaced whom - if a Season 1 player A feedbacked for player B and then B was equivalent exchanged with C later, then A, B and C should be after one another. It's not perfect - the players who have left the team and come back mess it up something fierce, but an attempt was made.</p>
					<p>For "longest time on the roster" options, note that it orders the players by the number of <em>days</em> on the roster, not seasons. Because the seasons have slightly different lengths, the order of players who spent, for example, one season on the roster may not look intuitive at first glance.</p>
